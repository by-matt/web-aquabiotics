# Aquabiotics Sur: Marine Circular Biorefinery

AquAbiotics is a biotechnology initiative dedicated to the valorization of industrial residues from the marine processing industry. We specialize in the recovery of high-value metabolites through a sustainable circular economy model.

## 🌊 Mission & Vision
Our mission is to transform environmental liabilities into high-purity functional ingredients. By utilizing advanced bioprocess engineering, we upcycle mussel cooking effluents into natural marine-derived products, such as taurine, significantly reducing the environmental footprint of coastal industries in Southern Chile.

## ♻️ Circular Economy Model
AquAbiotics operates at the heart of the blue economy. Our model creates a closed-loop system where:
- **Effluent Recovery**: Capturing residual cooking broth that would otherwise be discarded.
- **Molecular Valorization**: Isolate and concentrate endogenous marine metabolites using selective separation technologies.
- **Zero Waste Objective**: Minimizing the organic load (BOD/COD) in industrial discharges to preserve marine ecosystems.

## 🌍 Sustainability & Impact
Sustainability is our core driver. Our operations are designed to deliver measurable environmental and social value:
- **Resource Efficiency**: Maximizes the value of harvested marine resources without additional extraction.
- **Pollution Prevention**: Direct reduction of organic volume in industrial wastewater.
- **Territorial Development**: Strengthening the coastal economy through a high-tech platform that generates industrial efficiency.

## 📈 ESG Alignment
We are committed to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), focusing on:
- **SDG 2 (Zero Hunger)**: Enriching food chains with natural nutrients.
- **SDG 8 (Decent Work & Economic Growth)**: Strengthening coastal economies and creating high-tech industrial efficiency.
- **SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure)**: Pioneering circular biorefinery technologies.
- **SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption & Production)**: Promoting zero-waste circularity in industrial processes.
- **SDG 14 (Life Below Water)**: Protecting marine health by reducing organic load in industrial effluents.
